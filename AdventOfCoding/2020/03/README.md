# Sliding Through Snow Covered Forest

[AOC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

## SUMMARY

So, we get the tobagon and being the slide down. 




## 1st half

The first part has us checking to see how many trees we would hit going down at one angle.

## 2nd half

The second one wants us to try various angles and provide a product of the different tallies.

## Notes

* Note, the angle/route will extend beyond the width of the provided data... but the question notes that the forest repeats towards the right. nice.
